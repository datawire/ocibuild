		// ---------
		//
		// Some install tools automatically detect unfulfilled dependencies and
		// install them. In these cases, it is useful to track which
		// distributions were installed purely as a dependency, so if their
		// dependent distribution is later uninstalled, the user can be alerted
		// of the orphaned dependency.
		//
		// If a distribution is installed by direct user request (the usual
		// case), a file REQUESTED is added to the .dist-info directory of the
		// installed distribution. The REQUESTED file may be empty, or may
		// contain a marker comment line beginning with the "#" character.
		//
		// If an install tool installs a distribution automatically, as a
		// dependency of another distribution, the REQUESTED file should not be
		// created.
		//
		// The ``install`` command of distutils by default creates the REQUESTED
		// file. It accepts ``--requested`` and ``--no-requested`` options to explicitly
		// specify whether the file is created.
		//
		// If a distribution that was already installed on the system as a dependency
		// is later installed by name, the distutils ``install`` command will
		// create the REQUESTED file in the .dist-info directory of the existing
		// installation.
